This enables you to 'draw' the foundation of your desired image. The model then fills in the details, textures, and ultimately the aesthetic elements according to your guidance.\n",

By providing a reference image, you can define specific areas or objects within the image and instruct Amazon Titan Image Generator to generate content that matches the defined regions.
