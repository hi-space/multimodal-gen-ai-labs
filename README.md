# Multimodal Generative AI

This repository focuses on developing multimodal generative AI applications by leveraging various AWS services. It integrates various cutting-edge technologies and models to process and generate text, images, and other data types, offering a range of functionalities.

- **Multimodal LLM**: Enhances language understanding and generation by combining text and image data. It uses [Amazon Bedrock's Claude](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-claude.html).
  
- **Multimodal Embedding**: Represents text and images in a unified vector space, allowing for similarity comparison and retrieval between data. It uses the [Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-embedding-models.html) and the [Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1 model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-multiemb-models.html).
  
- **Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Receives text or images as input to retrieve relevant data and generates answers. It uses [Amazon Bedrock's Claude](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-claude.html), [Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-embedding-models.html), [Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1 model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-multiemb-models.html), and [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/what-is.html) as a vectorDB.

- **Image Generation with Multimodal LLM**: Generates high-quality images based on textual or multimodal inputs. It uses [Amazon Titan Image Generator G1 model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-image-models.html) and [Amazon Bedrock's Claude](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-claude.html).

This project demonstrates how AWS services are used to create, manage, and scale these multimodal AI capabilities. Whether youâ€™re building research tools, creative applications, or advanced AI solutions, this repository serves as a comprehensive starting point.
